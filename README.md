Here, I will document on a high-end model rocket flight computer for a rocket which can control itself without fins.
The flight computers will do the following:
1. It has 6 axis inertial measurement unit to measure orientation.
2. Precise barometer to find the height of flight.
3. three pyrotechnic channels to deploy parachutes and light second stage motor.
4. communication LED and buzzer.

Materials Required:
1. Printed Circuit Boards (download from: https://hacksterio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachments/1108247/omega_v4_dev_iH8wTGMZul.png)
