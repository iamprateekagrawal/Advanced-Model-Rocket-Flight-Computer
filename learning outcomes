Going through this project, I got to learn about things described below:

PCB(Printed Circuit Board):
1. Basically, helps to condense circuits to a single board piece with required connections and spaces for components.
2. Components attached via surface mounting (surface mounting devices or SMDs) or soldering through holes.
3. Made my own PCB for a blnking LED circuit, using EasyEDA software.

More on Arduino:
1. gyro and accelerometer in Arduino.
2. Kalman filtering technique.
3. Confusing long arduino codes :p
4. Using Teensy with arduino IDE
