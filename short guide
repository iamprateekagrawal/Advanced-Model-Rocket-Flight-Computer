Here I explain project setup in brief:

Step1: We download PCB file from https://hacksterio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachments/1108247/omega_v4_dev_iH8wTGMZul.png and order it.
Step2: soldering and assembly completed and 3D printed the two mounting brackets from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4308686

Flight computer done! Next is coding.

Step3: We download Arduino IDE and Teensyduino
Step4: We upload the code to the flight computer with servos plugged in.
